## üì¢ Announcement Text (Optional)

### Short Version (Twitter/X)
```
üéâ Released: Deterministic Flash Attention

Makes Flash Attention's forward pass deterministic with perfect batch invariance.

‚úÖ Bit-exact: batch=8 equals batch=4+4
‚ö†Ô∏è 2.2x slower, 3-5x memory
üìä Verified on A100

Perfect for validation/testing, not production training.

Built on @tri_dao's excellent work
Debugged with @AnthropicAI Claude

### Long Version (Blog/Reddit)
```
# Deterministic Flash Attention - Public Release

I'm releasing a modified version of Flash Attention that provides deterministic forward pass with perfect batch invariance.

## The Problem
Standard Flash Attention uses non-deterministic reduction. Processing batch=8 vs batch=4+4 gives slightly different results (~1e-6 difference). This makes debugging and testing difficult.

## The Solution
Modified the split-kv reduction to use PyTorch's deterministic operations instead of device-side atomics. Only 220 lines changed across 4 files.

## Verified Results (NVIDIA A100)
‚úÖ Batch invariance: Bit-exact (max diff = 0.0)
‚ö†Ô∏è Memory: 3-5x overhead (617MB for test case)
‚ö†Ô∏è Performance: 2.2x slower (6ms ‚Üí 13.5ms)

## Use Cases
Perfect for:
- Model validation and testing
- Reproducible research
- Debugging attention issues

NOT recommended for:
- Production training (2.2x slower)
- Memory-constrained workloads

## Full Transparency
- Complete patch files showing every change
- Honest about debugging iterations (took 6 hours)
- Developed with help from Claude (Anthropic)
- All missteps documented in commit history

Built on Tri Dao's excellent Flash Attention work - all the hard parts (CUDA kernels, optimization) are his. I just made the reduction deterministic.

## üí≠ Honest Framing

**The good:**
- Implementation works perfectly (all tests pass)
- Bit-exact determinism achieved
- Full transparency with patches

**The tradeoffs:**
- 2.2x slower (higher than hoped, but acceptable for validation)
- 3-5x memory overhead (manageable for testing)
- Not suitable for production training

**The honesty:**
- Took 6 hours with AI help (including debugging)
- Made mistakes with tensor layout
- Iterated to solution
- Publishing everything including missteps

**This honesty is your strength.** Most repos hide the iteration. You're showing the real development process.
